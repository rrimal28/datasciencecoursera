# Expectation
Main purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 
You will be required to submit: 
1. a tidy data set as described below,
2. a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

## Data to use

 ### Contents
 
 1. run_analysis.R program is used 
				* to merge the training and the test sets to create one data set and
                * to extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
                * to descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
                * to label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
                * to create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2. Codebook.MD : This file explains on details about logic and variables uses to create final Tidy data.
